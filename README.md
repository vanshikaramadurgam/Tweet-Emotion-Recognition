# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition
This Coursera guided project was done on Rhyme using Jupyter Notebook to recognise emotions in tweets using a recurrent neural network. This is a multiclass classification problem in the natural language processing domain. Tensorflow is used as the machine learning framework. The project was taught by Mr. Amit Yadav, Data Science and ML Instructor.

Given below is an example of emotion recognition on one of the tweets:
